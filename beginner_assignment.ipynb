We will be calculating the necessary time for a set of black holes to decay. We will assume that there exists 5 black holes that have the same mass as the Earth, Jupiter, the Sun, Sagittarius A* (the black hole at the center of our galaxy) and Phoenix A (the most massive black hole ever discovered) This will be more applicable for Task 2. \n",
