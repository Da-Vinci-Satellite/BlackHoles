    "1. Get acquainted with descriptions of a black hole, its structures and behavior\n",
    "2. Visualize how the black hole changes over time\n",
    "3. Discuss the information theory, mass conservation laws and energy conservation laws considering black hole evaporation"

We will be calculating the necessary time for a set of black holes to decay. We will assume that there exists 5 black holes that have the same mass as the Earth, Jupiter, the Sun, Sagittarius A* (the black hole at the center of our galaxy) and Phoenix A (the most massive black hole ever discovered) This will be more applicable for Task 2. \n",
