# Black holes Coding Assignments
This is the repository for the Blackholes Masterclass, and the coding assignments associated with it. Depending on the coding level of the students, there are two `ipython` notebooks that are provided.

## Beginner Level
This notebook covers all of the instructions that are needed with more depth, has more explanations on the basic concepts of functions, loops and plotting suing Python. It has a lot more comments in order to guide the students through the coding assignment, and most of the hard work is done for the student.

## Advanced Level
This notebook covers all of the instructions yet there is little to no support given to the student in terms of coding. Only verbal rules for the student to implement in their own terms are given so as to assure that the same result is reached with either of the Notebooks. The layout of this notebook is different from the Beginner level on purpose so as to assure a higher level assignment to the student.
